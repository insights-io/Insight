# Local test services

This is a collection of utilities and best practices for a local development environment.

## Docker-compose

For simple use-cases you can use `docker-compose`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Kubernetes (minikube)

We are using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) to run Kubernetes locally.
This helps us test services in Kubernetes environment before they are pushed into the Cloud.

### (One time) setup

```sh
brew install minikube
minikube config set memory 8192
minikube config set cpus 4
minikube config set disk-size 100GB
minikube start
minikube addons enable metrics-server ingress
```

### Point your shell to minikube's docker-deamon

```shell script
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

## Deploying a service to Kubernetes (example)

### (One time) setup

```sh
brew install kustomize
```

### Applying

```sh
docker build . -f auth/auth-api/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t eu.gcr.io/insight/auth-api
kustomize build auth/auth-api/k8/overlays/minikube | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Tilt

For a better experience with Kubernetes in development we use [tilt](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt).
Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date.
Think docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up.

### (One time setup)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilt-dev/tilt/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Spin up

```sh
tilt up
tilt up auth-api # start only auth-api
```
